# Visual-WSD
This repository contains the code for our (Elettra Favazza, Alan Picucci, Lorenzo Tarricone and yours truly) solution to the [Task 1 of the 17th international workshop about Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2023)](https://raganato.github.io/vwsd/), which consists in the following: given a potentially ambiguous word in a limited textual context, we aim to develop a deep learning model capable of selecting the most suitable image, from a set of 10 candidate images, that corresponds to the intended meaning of the target word.

We also include a report describing the models we implemented.
